# Changelog

## 0.1.3
* Fix msal-angular exports to properly support IE11: https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/pull/785
  * **Note**: Unfortunately, the fix above caused breakage with `aot` compiling, so `0.1.3` has been deprecated in npm. We recommend pinning to `0.1.2` while we work on a fix. See https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/issues/798
